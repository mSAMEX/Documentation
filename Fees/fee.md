Trading fees - Spot
Want to get more trading fee discounts? In order to show our appreciation for the continued support received from our users, mSamex is now launching a new Tiered Trading Fee Discount Program.

Program Rules:

At 00:00 AM (UTC+8) every day, mSamex will snapshot users’ SAMX holdings and their total trading volume (spot) over the past 30-day period (equivalent to BTC).
Users need to meet any one of the listed requirements to reach a specific Tier level and enjoy the corresponding trading fees.
User’s Tier level and corresponding trading fees are in effect for 24 hours, and automatically renewed daily.
